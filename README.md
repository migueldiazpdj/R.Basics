<h3>📝 Important Notes on Key Statistical Concepts:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>📊 Mean vs. Median:</strong><br>
      When the mean and median are significantly different, it indicates the presence of outliers in the sample, breaking the symmetry of the data.
  </li>
  <li><strong>📏 Quartiles vs. Percentiles</strong><br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>⚖️ Sample Variance vs. Population Variance:</strong><br>
      It is preferable to use sample variance (biased variance) over population variance. For large sample sizes, the difference becomes minimal.<br>
      In R, the <code>var</code> function calculates the sample variance, not the population variance.
  </li>
  <li><strong>📐 Interquartile Range (IQR):</strong><br>
      The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) within the dataset.
  </li>
  <li><strong>📉 Standard Deviation (SD):</strong><br>
      SD is defined as the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
  </li>
  <li><strong>🔄 Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Variables:</strong><br>
      <strong>Symmetric Variable:</strong> Data is evenly distributed around the mean.<br>
      <strong>Positive Skewness:</strong> The right tail is longer; mean > median.<br>
      <strong>Negative Skewness:</strong> The left tail is longer; mean < median.
  </li>
</ul>
